# spark.PageRank
Implement PageRank in Spark scala.

### Map:
We emit a (fromPage, toPage) tuple pair for each link of webpages. We create a ranks vector [(pageID1, rank), (pageID2, rank), â€¦] for each unique key of previous
tuples.

### Reduce:
To compute in parallel, we cannot construct a big matrix and do normal matrix vector multiplication. Notice that each (fromPage, toPage) is a cell (non-zero) in the stochastic web
matrix M. Group by fromPage, we essentially get a column to compute each new Ri with contribution (1/#outgoing links) * old_ Ri in Ranks vector V.
Reduce by key (_ + _) with toPageID as key, we will get the new rank for the given page.
